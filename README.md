This mod is meant as a drop-in replacement for any older (pre-2018) versions of xtraores (or just on its own as a mod). The old one needed some help. This is built with the server "Undercore" in mind. This can run completely vanilla, but I *highly* recommend all of the optional dependencies. See depends.txt for details.

In a nutshell:
---
*	Better guns
*	Better crafting
*	Much, much, **much**, less code
*	Therefore, much, **much** faster
*	A lot more balance (still some fantastical stuff though)
*	A whole lot awesomer

I don't want to explain stuff. Just use it and have fun.  

__Installation note:__  
Completely remove any old xtraores install before using this one (backups recommended)  
This is does not replace newer versions of xtraores (2018+)
